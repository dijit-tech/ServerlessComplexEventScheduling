# ServerlessComplexEventScheduling
Streamlining Operations with AWS Systems Manager Calendar and EventBridge Rules

## Introduction

AWS Eventbridge provides a serverless way of scheduling jobs within the cloud. There are options based on schedule and on event basis. Sometimes these jobs need to be modified based on calendar events. For example, 
1. Process payroll every Friday, except if Friday is a holiday, in which case schedule it on Thursday.
2. Process files from an external vendor every Monday morning. If there is a long weekend, then files should be processed only the following working day.

There is no direct way to use EventBridge to utilize a calendar for these type of scheduling.

Another service called AWS Systems Manager Calendar offers a familiar calendar interface to schedule events that an be used to trigger eventbride. This guide explores the integration of these services for efficient holiday scheduling.

## Understanding the Components

### AWS Systems Manager Calendar

Systems Manager Calendar allows defining operational periods like holidays for managing tasks. [Learn more about Systems Manager Calendar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-calendar.html).

### AWS EventBridge Rules

EventBridge facilitates event-driven architectures and triggers AWS services in response to events. [Explore EventBridge Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.html).

## Integration Use-Case: Holiday Scheduling

Integrating Systems Manager Calendar with EventBridge Rules is effective for pausing or modifying actions during holidays.

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

### Step 1: Set Up AWS Systems Manager Calendar

- **Create a Holiday Calendar**: Define your holiday calendar in Systems Manager. [Guide to create calendars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-calendar.html).
- **Input Holiday Dates**: Add specific holiday dates.

### Step 2: Create an EventBridge Rule

- **Define the Rule**: Set up an EventBridge rule for tasks like data backup. [Creating EventBridge Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule.html).
- **Set Up the Trigger**: Configure triggers based on events or schedules.

### Step 3: Integrate Systems Manager Calendar with EventBridge

- **Link the Calendar to the Rule**: Use the calendar's state as a condition in your EventBridge rule.
- **Configure Rule State**: The rule should respond to the calendar state, enabling or disabling as needed.

### Step 4: Testing and Validation

- **Test the Setup**: Adjust the calendar to simulate holidays and observe the ruleâ€™s behavior.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Monitor with AWS CloudWatch. [About CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html).

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Regularly Update the Holiday Calendar**: Keep the calendar updated with your organization's schedule.
- **Use Tags for Organization**: Effective for managing multiple calendars and rules.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensure alignment with organizational standards.

## Conclusion

Combining AWS Systems Manager Calendar with AWS EventBridge Rules enhances resource efficiency and operational control. Follow these steps for successful integration.

Happy automated holiday scheduling! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“†
